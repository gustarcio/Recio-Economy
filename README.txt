This repository is divided in a couple of .zip files. 

The Recio_Economy.zip file contains the source code in octave to simulate an manufacturing economy. The main file to be executed from the octave prompt is mainEconomy.m.

The ALIFE_paper_Experiments.zip is more specific and contains a summary of all configuration parameters and results of the experiments executed for the ALIFE paper "From Dynamics to Novelty" for replicability.
